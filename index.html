        <p>
            Always consult a healthcare professional before starting new medications or
            treatments. Regular check-ups, staying hydrated, and managing stress levels
            are critical for maintaining optimal health. Don't ignore early signs of
            illness, and prioritize mental well-being alongside physical health.
